You are given a string S of length N. S initially consists of '0', '1', and '?'. You need to replace '?' with either '0' or '1'.

In the final string (after all replacements), for every possible substring, absolute difference of the number of '1's and '0's must be not greater than K. 

Find the number of possible final strings modulo 10^9+7

1 <= K <= N <= 300
