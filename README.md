# AtCoder Translations

Unofficial short translations of [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/) problems from Japanese to English.

## How to use

In most cases, only short problem statement translation is provided, just enough to understand what needs to be done in the
problem.

Please still refer to the original Japanese problem page for the sample inputs and outputs.

## Contribute

There are still many problems untranslated, so contributions are very welcome!

It's very easy, and for one problem should take about 5-10 minutes, even if you don't speak Japanese.

* You can contribute right from your browser, there is a "Create new file" button in the GitHub UI (you can create folders too).\
  See how the current folders and files are organized, and try to follow the same pattern. Use Markdown in your file.

* Problems from AtCoder Beginner Contests 001–041 and AtCoder Regular contests 001–057 are untranslated. Pick some problem from these contests. Links to the contests are all like [https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc041](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc041) or [https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc057](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc057), just change the number in the URL. Check that the problem you picked is not already translated.\
  You can also find links to the problems and contests on [https://kenkoooo.com/atcoder#/table/](https://kenkoooo.com/atcoder#/table/)

* Understand what needs to be done in the problem (use Google Translate if you don't speak Japanese). Verify your understanding on samples.

* Write short description of the problem statement in English here. Just several sentences is enough, as long as it's clear what you need to find, and what are the constraints. There is no need to translate a story in the problem statement, or other unnecessary details.

* If you don't speak Japanese, please solve the problem first so that you are sure that you understood it correctly.
